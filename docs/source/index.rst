Welcome to sentimental-ensemble's documentation!
================================================

**Lumache** (/lu'make/) is a Python library.  It pulls data from the `Open Food
Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_ and offers a *simple* and
*intuitive* API.

Metafeatures:
========================

General: General information related to the dataset, also known as simple measures, such as the number of instances, attributes and classes.
Statistical: Standard statistical measures to describe the numerical properties of data distribution.
Information-theoretic: Particularly appropriate to describe discrete (categorical) attributes and their relationship with the classes.
Model-based: Measures designed to extract characteristics from simple machine learning models.
Landmarking: Performance of simple and efficient learning algorithms.
Relative Landmarking: Relative performance of simple and efficient learning algorithms.
Subsampling Landmarking: Performance of simple and efficient learning algorithms from a subsample of the dataset.
Clustering: Clustering measures extract information about dataset based on external validation indexes.
Concept: Estimate the variability of class labels among examples and the examples density.
Itemset: Compute the correlation between binary attributes.
Complexity: Estimate the difficulty in separating the data points into their expected classes.
